        <h3>A Code Review</h3>
        <p>
            <p><h4>Challenge name:</h4> RGB To Hex Conversion :Codewars</p>

            <p><h4>Description:</h4> To create a javascript function, which when given an rgb colour code, returns it's Hexadecimal equivalent.</p>

            <p><h4>My Solution:</h4></p>
<pre>                
    function rgb(r, g, b) {
        let ref = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
                  'A','B','C','D','E','F']
        let arr = []
        
        //Error checking
        
        if(r > 255){r = 255}
        if(g > 255){g = 255}
        if(b > 255){b = 255}
        
        if(r < 0){r = 0}
        if(g < 0){g = 0}
        if(b < 0){b = 0}
        
        //   divide by 16
        //   multiply remained by 16
        
        let r1 = Math.floor(r / 16)
        let r2 = ((r/16)-r1)*16
        arr.push(ref[r1]);
        arr.push(ref[Math.round(r2)]);
        
        let g1 = Math.floor(g / 16)
        let g2 = ((g/16)-g1)*16
        arr.push(ref[g1]);
        arr.push(ref[Math.round(g2)]);
        
        let b1 = Math.floor(b / 16)
        let b2 = ((b/16)-b1)*16
        arr.push(ref[b1]);
        arr.push(ref[Math.round(b2)]);
        
        //return "FFFFFF";

        return arr.join("")
    }
        
</pre>
        
        <p><h4>My Thought Process and Work Flow:</h4></p>
        
        <p>The initial part of the solution focuses upon having the correct rgb values in order to continue.  I tackled this using 'if' statements to make sure the values were within bounds.</p>

        <p>To calculate the hex from the rgb, I researched a formula which involved dividing the rgb by 16 (base16) to give a new value.  Then, handle the remainder seperately.  
        I then declared an array with all base16 values; of which, the corresponding element can be called using the new calculated value. This can then be added to a new array to hold the answer.
        When all rgb values are converted, the answer array is condensed in to a string and BINGO.</p>

            <p><h4>My analysis:</h4></p>
            <img class="logo" src=".\images\js.png" alt="Coming Soon" width="140">
            <p>As a first attempt I was happy to get a solution for the challenge. However, I knew while writing this code, that improvements could be made. 
            Most obvious to me, would be to create smaller internal functions which would handle error checking and conversion calculations.  This would replace the repeated code I used to handle each rgb value individually; and instead, would call the internal functions 3 times. 
            I am also aware that there may be a better way to handle the error checking of values which may be outside of bounds.  I believe there is a Math function which can do excatly this using a min/max.</p>

            <p>Looking through previous solutions to the challenge, it appears there is a much easier way of achieving the task using the object method '.toString(16)'.
            This method, with the '16' argument, will convert a number into a hexadecimal.</p>

            <p>Overall, I'm quite proud of finding a solution to this one, may be even more so, without using the toString method.
            However, I'll probably be using it from now on.</p>

        <h3>Work In Progress</h3>
        <p>As someone who prefers to use 'Dark Mode' plug-ins for all applications, I have been finding this an issue when creating this website. <br><br>

        Unwittingly, I set my colours up with dark mode turned on, only to find slight variations when dark mode was turned off. <br><br>

        This is something that I will have to give good consideration to in future tasks.  Furthermore, it has also drawn attention to the greater world of compatibility and general accessibility standards.
