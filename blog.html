            <h3>Week 3</h3>

            <p>During this week, the emphasis of the work has been orientated towards producing this website; pulling together the knowledge and skills developed in HTML and CSS over the last 2 weeks.
            Additionally, the course has been providing further tutorials on new aspects of CSS such as flexbox; which will also aid in the making of the this journal styled website.</p>

            <p>I have been able to make good progress on the website and have not run in to any major issues.  
            All small issues have been resolved through trial and error, reading course notes or online resources.
            Developing a personal website has been an excellent learning exercise, with small mistakes being their own learning tool.</p>

            <p>I continue to make progress with the codewars challenges.  
            A code review of one of my more enlightening challenges can be found HERE.</p>

            <h3>Week 2</h3>

            <p>Completed my 2nd week of Software Developing Bootcamp mon-fri, 9:30-4:30.
            This week covered the basics of HTML, CSS languages and SQL databases, which are topics that I have no experience of going into the course.  Although these subjects are new to me, I can see a lot commonality in structure from my experience with C#.  The tutorials have been informative and well guided.  The pace of exposure to new material has also been great.  I'm feeling confident with what I have learned so far and look forward to complementing this knowledge with javascript in the upcoming weeks.</p>

            <p>These will be great skills to add to my CV in the near futureas I gain further insight and make progress.</p>

            <h3>Week 1</h3>

            <p>Completed my first week at Software Development Bootcamp.
            Learned the basics of javascript and relevant software such as VS Code, Node JS and Git.
            Attended the first of a weekly session with an employability coach to assist with CVs, work searches, interviews, etc.
            Was introduced to codewars, of which, I'm looking forward to progressing through challenges and to more difficult levels.</p>

            <p>On first impressions of the course, it seems to deliver what I was hoping for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> A guided course through Javascript.</li>
                <li> Intergrating HTML and CSS to create websites.</li>
                <li> Guided tutorials through backend development and databases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For me, as someone who has been self teaching himself C#, the course has already been a good insight into how other developers work and what industry standards are commonplace.</p>
